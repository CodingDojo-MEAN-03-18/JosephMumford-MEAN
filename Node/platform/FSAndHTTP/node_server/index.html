        <h1>How could you?! Haven't you learned anything from that guy who gives those sermons at church? Captain Whatshisname? We live in a society of laws! Why do you think I took you to all those Police Academy movies? For fun? Well, I didn't hear anybody laughing, did you? Except at that guy who made sound effects. Makes sound effects and laughs. Where was I? Oh yeah! Stay out of my booze.</h1>
        <p>Donuts. Is there anything they can't do? Weaseling out of things is important to learn. It's what separates us from the animals…except the weasel. I was saying "Boo-urns." Aaah! Natural light! Get it off me! Get it off me!</p>
        <p>Jesus must be spinning in his grave! I'm normally not a praying man, but if you're up there, please save me, Superman. <strong> Our differences are only skin deep, but our sames go down to the bone.</strong> <em> Can't you people take the law into your own hands?</em> I mean, we can't be policing the entire city!</p>
        <h2>No children have ever meddled with the Republican Party and lived to tell about it.</h2>
        <p>Thank you, steal again. Inflammable means flammable? What a country. I hope this has taught you kids a lesson: kids never learn. Duffman can't breathe! OH NO! I've done everything the Bible says — even the stuff that contradicts the other stuff!</p>
        <ol>
        <li>A lifetime of working with nuclear power has left me with a healthy green glow…and left me as impotent as a Nevada boxing commissioner.</li><li>Your guilty consciences may make you vote Democratic, but secretly you all yearn for a Republican president to lower taxes, brutalize criminals, and rule you like a king!</li><li>What's the point of going out? We're just going to wind up back here anyway.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Fame was like a drug. But what was even more like a drug were the drugs.</h3>
        <p>Books are useless! I only ever read one book, "To Kill A Mockingbird," and it gave me absolutely no insight on how to kill mockingbirds! Sure it taught me not to judge a man by the color of his skin…but what good does *that* do me? Old people don't need companionship. They need to be isolated and studied so it can be determined what nutrients they have that might be extracted for our personal use.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>I hope this has taught you kids a lesson: kids never learn.</li><li>Oh, I'm in no condition to drive. Wait a minute. I don't have to listen to myself. I'm drunk.</li><li>When will I learn? The answers to life's problems aren't at the bottom of a bottle, they're on TV!</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Bart, with $10,000 we'd be millionaires! We could buy all kinds of useful things like…love! I hope I didn't brain my damage. I stand by my racial slur. Remember the time he ate my goldfish? And you lied and said I never had goldfish. Then why did I have the bowl, Bart? *Why did I have the bowl?*</p>
        <p>I like my beer cold, my TV loud and my homosexuals flaming. Marge, it takes two to lie. One to lie and one to listen. You don't like your job, you don't strike. You go in every day and do it really half-assed. That's the American way.</p>
        <p>Inflammable means flammable? What a country. Me fail English? That's unpossible. D'oh. This is the greatest case of false advertising I've seen since I sued the movie "The Never Ending Story." I didn't get rich by signing checks.</p>
        <p>A woman is a lot like a refrigerator. Six feet tall, 300 pounds…it makes ice. Uh, no, they're saying "Boo-urns, Boo-urns." Beer. Now there's a temporary solution. Jesus must be spinning in his grave!</p>
        <p>You don't like your job, you don't strike. You go in every day and do it really half-assed. That's the American way. No children have ever meddled with the Republican Party and lived to tell about it. "Thank the Lord"? That sounded like a prayer. A prayer in a public school. God has no place within these walls, just like facts don't have a place within an organized religion.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Krabappel and Principal Skinner were in the closet making babies and I saw one of the babies and then the baby looked at me. Homer no function beer well without. Old people don't need companionship. They need to be isolated and studied so it can be determined what nutrients they have that might be extracted for our personal use.</p>
        <p>…And the fluffy kitten played with that ball of string all through the night. On a lighter note, a Kwik-E-Mart clerk was brutally murdered last night. "Thank the Lord"? That sounded like a prayer. A prayer in a public school. God has no place within these walls, just like facts don't have a place within an organized religion.</p>
        <p>Last night's "Itchy and Scratchy Show" was, without a doubt, the worst episode *ever.* Rest assured, I was on the Internet within minutes, registering my disgust throughout the world. …And the fluffy kitten played with that ball of string all through the night.

        <p>A woman is a lot like a refrigerator. Six feet tall, 300 pounds…it makes ice. Kids, you tried your best and you failed miserably. The lesson is, never try. Books are useless! I only ever read one book, "To Kill A Mockingbird," and it gave me absolutely no insight on how to kill mockingbirds! Sure it taught me not to judge a man by the color of his skin…but what good does *that* do me?</p>
        <p>The Internet King? I wonder if he could provide faster nudity… Ahoy hoy? I can't go to juvie. They use guys like me as currency. Kids, we need to talk for a moment about Krusty Brand Chew Goo Gum Like Substance. We all knew it contained spider eggs, but the hantavirus? That came out of left field. So if you're experiencing numbness and/or comas, send five dollars to antidote, PO box…</p>
        <p>Aaah! Natural light! Get it off me! Get it off me! I don't like being outdoors, Smithers. For one thing, there's too many fat children. I didn't think it was physically possible, but this both sucks *and* blows.</p>
